Splitting interfaces and implementations using variadic template inheritance ðŸ¤”
Modern C++ allows us to build highly flexible and controlled class hierarchies.
One very elegant technique to split access to a concrete implementation class is by combining:
- Interfaces (pure virtual classes) to define capabilities.
- Variadic template inheritance to combine multiple capabilities into one class flexibly.
This pattern allows you to keep clean abstraction boundaries and keep implementation at the single unit.
